<p>The fundamental of internal combustion engines shows that the engine power is delivered by the compression of fuel-mixture and combustion in the cylinder. Since air intake is essential in enhancing engine performance and fuel economy, we will look at how the tuning of intake manifold will contribute to higher engine performance.</p>
<h1><strong>2.0 Manifold Overview</strong></h1>
<p>An intake manifold is defined as a part of an engine that supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders. As shown in Figure 1, the ambient air enters the air intake and the amount of the air entering manifold is mainly controlled by throttle body. The upstream part of the manifold before air gets distributed is called the manifold plenum and the individual ducts downstream are called manifold runners. Differences in Plenum and runner design can bring influences on engine performance. For instance, A high-performance manifold typically has large plenum and oversized runners to allow large mass flow of air into the cylinder. Additionally, the minor loss of air flow ca be reduced by having fewer bends and matching the size of runner inlet and cylinder head.</p>

<p>the volumetric efficiency equals to the actual air inducted over the theoretical amount of the air.&nbsp; Therefore, for the same amount of theoretical air, the more air enters the cylinder, the higher volumetric efficiency. To increase the volumetric efficiency, it is necessary to take pressure wave phenomena into consideration. Figure 2 shows the generation of expansion and compression pressure waves generated due to the open and close of intake valve. Shortly after the inlet valve of cylinder opens, the pressure in the cylinder drops and an expansion (associate with decrese in pressure) wave starts traveling towards the atmosphere end of manifold. The traveling speed of the wave is a-v, where a is the isentropic speed of sound while v is the fluid velocity in the manifold. When the wave reaches the open end of the pipe, the expansion wave is refelected as the a compression wave with a the speed of a+v. If the manifold is well designed, the inlet valve will be closing when the compression wave arrives and the compression wave will result in an increase in pressure. The increase of pressure will help to bring more air into the cylinder and enhance the volumetric efficiency.</p>
